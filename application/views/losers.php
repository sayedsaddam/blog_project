He was elected as Chief Minister of Punjab for the third time in the 2013 general election and served his term until his party's defeat in the 2018 general election. During his tenure as chief minister, Shehbaz enjoyed a reputation as a highly competent and diligent administrator.[3] He initiated ambitious infrastructure projects in Punjab and was noted for his efficient governance. Shehbaz was nominated as the president of the Pakistan Muslim League-N after his brother, Nawaz Sharif, was disqualified from holding office in the wake of the Panama Papers case. He was nominated as the Leader of the Opposition after the 2018 election.</p>

			<p class="text-justify">In December 2019, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) froze 23 properties belonging to Shehbaz and his son, Hamza Sharif, accusing them of money laundering. On 28 September 2020, NAB arrested Shehbaz at Lahore High Court and indicted him on charges of money laundering. He was incarcerated pending trial. On 14 April 2021, Lahore High Court released him on bail in money laundering reference. Amid the 2020–2022 Pakistani political crises, he was elected Prime Minister on 11 April 2022 after the no-confidence motion against Imran Khan.</p>

			<h2>Initial Political Career</h2>

			<h2>After joining Politics - Crime history begins</h2>
			<p class="lead">Sabzazar Case - The first case</p>
			<p class="text-justify">In 1999, a complainant Saeeduddin lodged FIR and accused Shehbaz of allowing the Sabzazar police, as the Chief Minister of the Punjab, to kill his son along with other men in a fake encounter.[31] In the encounter, his two sons and three other people were killed by the police.</p>

			<p class="text-justify">In 2003, an anti-terrorism court summoned Shehbaz and five others accused in alleged extrajudicial killings in 1998. He was in the exile at that time and failed to show-up to the court. Later, the court issued an arrest warrant for Shehbaz. In 2004, Shehbaz attempted to return to Pakistan to appear before the court, but was forcibly deported back to Saudi Arabia.</p>

			<p class="text-justify">In August 2007, the Supreme Court of Pakistan gave its verdict which allowed Sharif brothers to return to Pakistan. In September 2007, an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan ordered police to arrest Shehbaz based on a 2003 arrest warrant. He later got bail from anti-terrorism court Shehbaz denied ordering the alleged killings and said the charges against him were politically motivated. He further said that in 2004 he had landed at the Lahore Airport wanting to appear before the court, but was sent back to Saudi Arabia by the government in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court. In 2008, he was acquitted by the Anti-Terrorism Court in the Sabzazar case.</p>

			<h2>Money Laundering Case</h2>
			<p>On 28 September 2020, Shehbaz was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau on charges of laundering over ₨7,328 million (US$41 million) in a systematic scheme involving close associates and family members. The Bureau had previously frozen 23 different properties belonging to Sharif, his son, and other family members, claiming that these assets were acquired beyond known sources of income. The NAB alleges that the Shehbaz Sharif family used fake transactions to receive foreign funds, with the transactions being made through a company owned by Sharif's son-in-law, Haroon Yousaf.</p>

			<h2>How did he become a PM? [ Illegally ]</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">On 10 April 2022, Sharif was nominated as candidate for Prime Minister by opposition parties following a vote of no confidence in incumbent Prime Minister Imran Khan after the 2022 Pakistani constitutional crisis.</p>

			<p class="text-justify">He was elected Prime Minister on 11 April 2022. He took the oath of office on the same day, administered by the Chairman of the Senate, Sadiq Sanjrani, acting for President Arif Alvi, who was on medical leave after complaining of “discomfort”.</p>

			<h2>The Illegal and the most disgraced PM ever</h2>
			<p>The PML-N with 11 other opposition parties ran a campaign against the Prime Minister Imran Khan (Who's still the most popular leader in Pakistan) to oust him with the help of America. As he visited Russia a day before the war broke out.</p>
